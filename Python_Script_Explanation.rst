This Python script is a simple data polling client that retrieves JSON data from a server endpoint in a loop. Below is an explanation of the code:

Code Breakdown
--------------

1. **Imports**:
   ```python
   import requests
   import json
   ```
   - The script uses the `requests` library for making HTTP requests and `json` for working with JSON data (although JSON-specific functionality isn't directly used in this script).

2. **Variables**:
   ```python
   prefix="https://..." # Replace with the correct address
   seq=-1
   ```
   - **prefix**: This variable holds the base URL of the server. Replace `"https://..."` with the actual URL.
   - **seq**: Initializes the sequence number to `-1`. This is used to keep track of the latest data already processed.

3. **Infinite Loop**:
   ```python
   while True:
   ```
   - The loop runs indefinitely, continually polling the server for new data.

4. **Request Building**:
   ```python
   request = "?from={}".format(seq+1) if seq>-1 else ""
   url = prefix+"/cbserver/te0/api/data"+request
   ```
   - If `seq` is greater than `-1`, the script adds a query parameter `from=<seq+1>` to the URL, indicating the server should only return data starting from the sequence number `seq + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the script sends a request without the query parameter.

5. **Making the HTTP GET Request**:
   ```python
   response = requests.get(url)
   ```
   - The script sends a GET request to the constructed URL.

6. **Response Handling**:
   ```python
   if response:
   ```
   - If the response is successful (HTTP status code 200), the script processes the JSON data returned by the server.

7. **Processing Returned Data**:
   ```python
   for data in response.json():
       s = data["seq"]
       if s > seq:
           print(data)
           seq = s
   ```
   - The response is expected to be a JSON array. The script iterates through the data:
     - It checks the `seq` value of each item.
     - If the `seq` value is greater than the current `seq`, it prints the data and updates the `seq` variable to reflect the highest sequence number seen so far.

8. **Error Handling**:
   ```python
   else:
       print("Failed: ", response.status_code)
   ```
   - If the response is unsuccessful (e.g., 404, 500), the script prints the failure message along with the HTTP status code.

Example Workflow
----------------

1. **Initial Request**:
   - When `seq = -1`, the script sends a request to the base endpoint without any `from` parameter.
   - The server responds with all available data.

2. **Subsequent Requests**:
   - For every subsequent iteration, the script requests data starting from the last processed sequence number (`seq + 1`).

3. **Continuous Polling**:
   - The script continuously checks for new data from the server and only processes data with a higher sequence number than previously seen.

Notes
-----

- **Endpoint URL**: Replace `"https://..."` with the correct server address.
- **Data Format**: The server is expected to return a JSON array of objects, each containing at least a `seq` field.
- **Infinite Loop Caution**: The loop runs forever. You might want to include a sleep timer (e.g., `time.sleep(n)`) or a termination condition for real-world use.
- **Error Handling**: The script doesnâ€™t handle cases like malformed JSON, network errors, or rate-limiting from the server. You can enhance it to be more robust.
